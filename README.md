<strong>Overview </strong>

In this project you will create 3 simple, images or your choice and use Java 2D graphic methods to rotate, scale and translate each of the images.

<strong>Requirements: </strong>

<ol>

 <li>Using Netbeans or Eclipse, develop a Java 2D graphics application that creates 3 images. The images should have the following specifications:

  <ol>

   <li>Size: minimum 25×25 pixels, larger images are Okay</li>

   <li>Type: Color (consists of two or more colors)</li>

   <li>Simple form or shape (Hint: consider a letter or number, or even simple shapes such as crossing lines, rectangles, or circles</li>

   <li>You should generate the image inside of separate methods and store them as 2D arrays.</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Use Java 2D graphics to display your original images.</li>

 <li>For each image use the existing Java 2D graphics transformation methods to translate, rotate and scale each object. You should perform the following transformations on each image:

  <ol>

   <li>Translate -5 in x direction, Translate +7 in the y direction.</li>

   <li>Rotate 45 counter clockwise.</li>

   <li>Rotate 90 clockwise</li>

   <li>Scale 2 times for the x component, scale 0.5 times for the y component</li>

   <li>Each of these transformations should be displayed in sequence with the images always starting from the previous transformation as opposed to the original image.</li>

   <li>Use Java 2D graphics to display each transformation for each image. (Hint: review the Project 1 template for a good start for this project.)</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>All Java source code should be written using Google Java style guide.</li>

 <li>Prepare, conduct and document a test plan verifying your application is working as expected. This plan should include a test matrix listing each method you tested, how you tested it, and the results of testing.</li>

</ol>
